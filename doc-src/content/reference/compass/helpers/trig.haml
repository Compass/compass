  Trigonometric functions can help you manage complex calculations involving angles.
  Or maybe they can be used to create pretty pictures. Who knows?


#pi.helper
  %h3
    %a(href="#pi")
      pi()
  .details
    %p
      Returns the value of Ï€.

#sin.helper
  %h3
    %a(href="#sin")
      sin($number)
  .details
    %p
      Returns the sine of a number. If the number is unitless or has a unit of <code>deg</code>
      then it will return a unitless result. Unless the number has a unit of <code>deg</code> it
      will be evaluated as radians. Degrees will first be converted to radians.
      If the number is any other unit, the units will be passed thru to the result,
      and the number will be treated as radians.

#cos.helper
  %h3
    %a(href="#cos")
      cos($number)
  .details
    %p
      Returns the cosine of a number. If the number is unitless or has a unit of <code>deg</code>
      then it will return a unitless result. Unless the number has a unit of <code>deg</code> it
      will be evaluated as radians. Degrees will first be converted to radians.
      If the number is any other unit, the units will be passed thru to the result,
      and the number will be treated as radians.
#tan.helper
  %h3
    %a(href="#tan")
      tan($number)
  .details
    %p
      Returns the tangent of a number. If the number is unitless or has a unit of <code>deg</code>
      then it will return a unitless result. Unless the number has a unit of <code>deg</code> it
      will be evaluated as radians. Degrees will first be converted to radians.
      If the number is any other unit, the units will be passed thru to the result,
      and the number will be treated as radians.
