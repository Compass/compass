Please join us in welcoming Anthony Short to the Compass core team.
Anthony has been an active member in the "CSS Compiler" community for
a very long time now. A couple years ago he shut down his own CSS
compiler project called [Scaffold](https://github.com/anthonyshort/Scaffold)
and gave his backing to the Sass/Compass community. Since then, he
has been an active member of our community.

Anthony is a Designer and Developer at [Newism](http://newism.com.au/) a
web design and marketing firm in Newcastle, Australia. His depth and
breadth of knowledge about CSS and cutting-edge design is evident in
his work and his excellent pattern library for Compass:
[Stitch](https://github.com/anthonyshort/stitch-css).

You can find Anthony on the web at these fine locations:
