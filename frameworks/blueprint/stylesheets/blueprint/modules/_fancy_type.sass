/*
  For great looking quote marks in titles, replace "asdf" with:
  <span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>asdf&#8221;
  (That is, when the title starts with a quote mark). 
  (You may have to change this value depending on your font size).

  Reduced size type with incremental leading
  (http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/incremental_leading/)
  
  This could be used for side notes. For smaller type, you don't necessarily want to 
  follow the 1.5x vertical rhythm -- the line-height is too much. 
  
  Using this class, it reduces your font size and line-height so that for 
  every four lines of normal sized type, there is five lines of the sidenote. eg:
  
  New type size in em's:
    10px (wanted side note size) / 12px (existing base size) = 0.8333 (new type size in ems)
  
  New line-height value:
    12px x 1.5 = 18px (old line-height)
    18px x 4 = 72px 
    72px / 5 = 14.4px (new line height)
    14.4px / 10px = 1.44 (new line height in em's)
=incr
  :font-size 10px
  :line-height 1.44em
  :margin-bottom 1.5em

  Surround uppercase words and abbreviations with this class.
