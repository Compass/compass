	STARKERS

	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

	Starkers is a bare-bones WordPress theme created 
	to act as a starting point for the theme designer.	Free of all presentational elements and non-semantic 
	markup, Starkers is the perfect 'blank slate' for 
	your WordPress projects, as it's a stripped-back 
	version of the 'Twenty Ten' theme (versions prior to 
	3.0 were based on the now-retired 'Default' theme).	Best of all: it's free and fully GPL-licensed, 
	so you can use it for whatever you like â€” even 
	your commercial projects.
