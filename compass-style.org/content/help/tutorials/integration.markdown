# Application Integration

## Ruby on Rails

### Rails 3.1
Just add compass to your Gemfile like so:
    
    gem 'compass'
    
Also checkout this [gist](https://gist.github.com/1184843)
  
### Rails 3
    compass init rails /path/to/myrailsproject
### Rails 2.3
    rake rails:template LOCATION=http://compass-style.org/rails/installer
    
## Sinatra

    require 'compass'
    require 'sinatra'
    require 'haml'

    configure do
      set :haml, {:format => :html5}
      set :scss, {:style => :compact, :debug_info => false}
      Compass.add_project_configuration(File.join(Sinatra::Application.root, 'config', 'compass.rb'))
    end

    get '/stylesheets/:name.css' do
      content_type 'text/css', :charset => 'utf-8'
      scss :"stylesheets/#{params[:name]}", Compass.sass_engine_options
    end

    get '/' do
      haml :index
    end


This assumes you keep your Compass config file in `config/compass.rb`. If you keep your stylesheets in “views/stylesheets/” directory instead of just “views/”, remember to update `sass_dir` configuration accordingly.

### Minimal integration: just drop it in

One simple route for lightweight integration is to simply install compass inside nanoc. Then edit `config.rb` to point to the stylesheets you want to use. This means you have to have the Compass watch command running in a separate window from the Nanoc compilation process. 

Example project that works this way: [unthinkingly](http://github.com/unthinkingly/unthinkingly-blog).

### More formal integration

At the top of the Nanoc Rules file, load the Compass configuration, like this:

    require 'compass'

    Compass.add_project_configuration 'compass.rb'        # when using Compass > 0.10
    sass_options = Compass.sass_engine_options            # when using Compass > 0.10

    Compass.configuration.parse 'compass.rb'              # when using Compass < 0.10
    sass_options = Compass.config.to_sass_engine_options  # when using Compass < 0.10

Then create a `compass.rb` file in your site's root folder and add your Compass configuration. An example configuration could look like this:

    http_path = "/"
    project_path = File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..'))
    css_dir = "output/stylesheets"
    sass_dir = "content/stylesheets"
    images_dir = "assets/images"
    javascripts_dir = "assets/javascripts"
    fonts_dir = "assets/fonts"
    http_javascripts_dir = "javascripts"
    http_stylesheets_dir = "stylesheets"
    http_images_dir = "images"
    http_fonts_dir = "fonts"

You may need to change the path to some directories depending on your directory structure and the setup in your Rules file.

To filter the stylesheets using Sass and Compass, call the sass filter with Sass engine options taken from Compass, like this:

    compile '/stylesheets/*' do
      filter :sass, sass_options.merge(:syntax => item[:extension].to_sym)
    end
