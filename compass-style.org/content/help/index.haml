  %h1 Getting started with Compass

  :markdown
    Compass is an open-source CSS authoring framework which uses the [Sass stylesheet
    language](http://sass-lang.com) to make writing stylesheets powerful and easy. If you're
    not familiar with Sass, you can take a look at [these simple tutorials](http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html)
    to get caught up.

    ## Installing Compass

    Compass is a tool that runs on the command line. On any system with ruby installed, open your terminal and type:

        gem install compass

    This will install Compass and Sass too. If you want to verify that compass is installed:

        compass version

    ## Manual Setup

        compass create /path/to/project
        cd /path/to/project
        compass watch

    Now you can edit the `*.scss` files in the `sass` directory with the text editor of your choice.
    the `compass watch` process will automatically compile your them into css in the stylesheets directory whenever they change.
    The files in the `sass` directory are yours and you can change them, delete them, add new ones, etc.

    ## Rails Setup

      Use [compass-rails](https://github.com/Compass/compass-rails)
